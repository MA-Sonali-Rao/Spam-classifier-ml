# Spam Email Classifier
This is a beginner - level machine learning project that classifies emails as **spam** or **ham(not spam)** using python.
## Project Overview
Email spam detection is a common real-world problem where machine learning can be applied to classify text data.
In this project, I implemented a basic spam classifier to understand text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification.
## Dataset
-Dataset used: 'spam.csv'  
-Source: Kaggle  
-The dataset contains labeled email messages categorized as spam or ham.  
## Technologies Used
-Python  
-Jupyter Notebook  
-Pandas  
-Scikit-Learn  
-Natural Langauge Processing(NLP)  
## Workflow
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Cleaned and preprocessed text data
3. Converted text into numerical features using vectorization
4. Trained a machine learning classification model
5. Evaluated the model performance
## Learning Outcomes
-Understood basic NLP concepts  
-Learned how text data is prepared for ML models  
-Gained hands-on experience with scikit-learn  
-Learned how to structure and upload an ML project to GitHub  
## Future Improvements
-Try different classifiers  
-Improve text preprocessing  
-Deploy the model as a simple web app
